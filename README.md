This game allows a player to play pong with himself/herself. The player towards whom the ball is moving becomes active and can
control his pad with the arrow keys. During this time, the other player is inactive. As soon as the ball changes direction, the 
other player becomes active. At the start of the game, the ball always goes to the player on the right. The ball's velocity is 
generated randomly, and sometimes, it may take a strange value, causing the ball to move very slow or almost vertically. Waiting 
patiently or restarting the game will generally solve this issue.



The game uses python 2.7 and pygame.
use "python main.py" to run the game. It will present the user with a very simple menu.The game logic is in "game.py".
